This project contains some graphics samples for generating Archimedean-based spirals, as well as Cissoid, Cochleoid, Conchoid, Lissajous, and Lituus-based curves.
Please remember that these code samples are for illustrative purposes only, which means that they are not optimized for performance.
Although the set of graphics primitives in Lua (only circles, rectangles, and rounded rectangles) is much smaller than other scripting languages, Lua does support gradients, animation, and events.
